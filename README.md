# Documentation

The database of Primitive protocol contracts and documentation is hosted on notion here: [Primitive Protocol HQ](https://www.notion.so/primitivefi/Primitive-Protocol-HQ-fc081b939bb04e2a90ccaebf36faa78e)

## Contracts

Primitive is a decentralized protocol for options that is focused on security and simplicity. Users and developers will tap into the protocol to offer and underwrite tokenized options on any ERC-20 token. The protocol operates without any centralized control, enabling an immutable set of smart contracts to work in perpetuity on Ethereum.

This repository has the core contracts for the Option primitives.

The live contract addresses are [here](https://www.notion.so/primitivefi/dc3b883ff9d94044b6738701b2826f7a?v=9e56507d430d4f4fb1939242cfb23736).

We use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) as a development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying the contracts.
