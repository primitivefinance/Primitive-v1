#### Coverage

For coverage, we use buidler's plugin for solidity-coverage.

    npm run coverage

#### Linting

For linting you can run this command which uses the solium linter:

    npm run lint

Solium can also fix some linting errors which can be checked with this command:

    npm run lint:fix

#### Static analysis

For static analysis you can run the contracts through slither with this command:

    npm slither
